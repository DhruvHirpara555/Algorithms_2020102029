#  Divide and conquer 

## General Strategy

1. Divide the problem if size **n** into some **a** number of subproblems. Each subproblem of size some **n/b**
2.  Find relation between solution solution of problem and solution of **a** subproblems
3. Recursively solve the subproblems.
4. Get the solution of problem from the solution  of sub problems

## General method to find time complexity(Master theorem)

We use master theorem to find time the time complexity of Divide and Conquer algos

**General Recurrence relation**
$$
T(n) = aT(n/b) + O(n^d), \ \ \ where \ \ a>0, b>1, d\ge1
$$
**Master Theorem**: For the above recurrence relation.
$$
T(n) = \begin{cases} O(n^d) & \ if \ d > \log_b a \\ O(n^d \log_bn) & \ if \  d = \log_b a \\ O(n^{\log_b a}) & \ if \  d <\log_b a \end{cases}
$$

**Three Cases**

1. The ratio is less than 1: The series is decreasing,  its sum is just given by its first term(Most Dominant), $O(n^d)$
2. The ratio is greater than 1 :The series is increasing, its sum is just given by its last term(Most Dominant),  $O(n^d \cdot (\frac{a}{b^d})^{\log_bn})$ which simplifies to $O(n^{\log_b a})$
3. The ratio is =1 : In this case all $\log_b(n)$ levels has $O(n^d)$ work, which gives  $O(n^d \log_bn)$â€‹
