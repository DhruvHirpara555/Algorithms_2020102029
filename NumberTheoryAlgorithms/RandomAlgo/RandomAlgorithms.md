# Randomized Algorithm

Surprisingly, some of the fastest and cleverest algorithms we've ever seen rely on chance at some stages and then continue based on random events (not deterministic).

They are primarily intended for difficult tasks for which no efficient algorithm exists.

For this, we primarily construct a collection of really simple algorithms whose output is highly likely to be right. Then we can improve the probability even more by picking a few algorithms at random from the list and using majority logic.

A randomised algorithm is a method that incorporates randomness into its logic. In a conventional algorithm, it is typically used to reduce either the running time, or time complexity; or the memory consumed, or space complexity. The method operates by generating a random number, rr, from a set of integers and making judgments based on the value of rr.
